If you have a question that is not answered below, search for your question here: <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/quelea-discuss>. If you cannot find any information about your question there already, feel free to ask a new question.

Can I translate Quelea to \[...\]?
----------------------------------

Yes, that would be terrific! Head to <https://quelea.org/lang/> and follow the instructions there.

What is a CI / nightly release?
-------------------------------

A nightly release or a CI (continuous integration) release is a version that is not yet tested at all, but automatically built from the latest code in the repository – in other words: the latest bleeding edge release, so potentially buggy. This might contain experimental features and could potentially be less stable, but we try our best to keep them as stable as possible. However, you are not advised to use a CI release in a live setting where no issues can be tolerated. If you would like to try the latest CI release, download it here: <https://github.com/quelea-projection/Quelea/releases/tag/CI-RELEASE>

When will the next stable release be available?
-----------------------------------------------

This highly depends on development activity and any critical bugs that come to light. We usually release a couple of versions a year, but that number will vary depending on how much there is to release! If you really need a better estimate, ask on the mailing list.

Will you add (x) feature?
-------------------------

There are many planned features on the to-do list, but feel free to let the developers know what features you miss, since features are added by popular demand. Visit the page <https://quelea.org/feedback/> to see planned features and vote for the features you want to see or discuss them in the discussion forum. Some of the planed features include:

-   Theme improvements
-   Initial install wizard
-   Show first line of next slide on stage view
-   Transition between slides
-   The option to store notices

How do I report a bug/error?
----------------------------

To help us better troubleshoot and fix the error we'll need [debug log](/Debug_log), so please follow the instructions on that page.

Next, go to the [discussion group](https://groups.google.com/forum/\#!forum/quelea-discuss) and see if anyone else has already reported the same thing. Lastly, if you cannot find a thread containing your question, start a new question, describe the problem and attach the debug log.

If I donate money, will Quelea be developed faster?
---------------------------------------------------

I am afraid that the development of Quelea is determined by time rather than by money. Quelea is developed by a few people in their spare time and that amount of time unfortunately cannot be changed by donations.

Where can I find free resources for Quelea?
-------------------------------------------

If you visit <http://quelea.org/resources/> you will find a few links to some free resources.
