If you have a question that is not answered below, search for your
question here: <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/quelea-discuss>.
If you cannot find any information about your question there already,
feel free to ask a new question.

## Can I translate Quelea to \[...\]?

Yes, that would be terrific\! Head to <https://quelea.org/lang/> and
follow the instructions there.

## What is a CI / nightly release?

A nightly release or a CI (continuous integration) release is a version
that is not yet tested at all, but automatically build from the latest
code in the repository – in other words: the latest bleeding edge
release, so potentially buggy. This might contain experimental features
and could potentially be less stable, but we try our best to keep them
as stable as possible. However, you are not advised to use a CI release
in a live setting where no issues can be tolerated. If you would like to
try the latest CI release, download it here:
<https://github.com/quelea-projection/Quelea/releases/tag/CI-RELEASE>

## When will the next stable release be available?

This highly depends on development activity and and critical bugs that
come to light. We usually release a couple of versions a year, but that
number will vary depending on how much there is to release\! If you
really need a better estimate, ask on the mailing list.

## Will you add (x) feature?

Maybe! Feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/quelea-projection/Quelea/issues), and we'll evaluate whether it's something that we can reasonably add.

## How do I report a bug/error?

Start by reproducing the error and then close Quelea. This will update
the debug log. Secondly, locate the debug log. Go to Help and About,
there you will find a link to the debug log. If you click it, the debug
log will open in your default text editor. Save a copy of the file
somewhere you know where it is so that you easily can attach it later
on. Next, go to the discussion group
(https://groups.google.com/forum/\#\!forum/quelea-discuss) and see if
anyone else already has reported the same thing. Lastly, if you cannot
find a thread containing your question, start a new question, describe
the problem and attach the debug log.

Alternatively, [create an issue](https://github.com/quelea-projection/Quelea/issues) directly and we'll take a look (you're much less likely to get potential feedback and help from other users though if you post it as an issue, so we'd advise doing that only if you're sure it's a bug.)

## If I donate money, will Quelea be developed faster?

I am afraid that the development of Quelea rather is determined by time
than by money. Quelea is developed by a few persons in their spare time
and that amount of time unfortunately cannot be changed by donations.

## Where can I find free resources for Quelea?

If you visit <http://quelea.org/resources/> you will find a few links to
some free resources.
