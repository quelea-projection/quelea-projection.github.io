If you cannot find the answer to the problem you are looking for here, search for your issue in the [discussion group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/quelea-discuss). If you cannot find any information about your issues there already, feel free to ask a new question.

The video background flickers as it repeats
-------------------------------------------

Some users have reported the following to help with this:

1.  Open VLC
2.  Open _preferences_
3.  Find _Video_
4.  Uncheck the box _Accelerated video output (Overlay)_

In newer versions, that option doesn't exist, so you'll need to do this:

1.  Open VLC
2.  Open _preferences_
3.  Select _All_ under _Show settings_ (bottom left)
4.  Select _Video_ -&gt; _Output modules_
5.  Under _Video output module_, select _DirectDraw_.
6.  Select _Video_ -&gt; _Output modules_ -&gt; _DirectDraw_
7.  Uncheck _Overlay video output_.

My animations/transitions in a presentation do not appear
---------------------------------------------------------

Try to use the native [PowerPoint or OpenOffice support](/Presentations_tab "wikilink") instead. The built-in presentation feature converts your presentation to a set of images and will therefore not preserve any transitions or any other effects you might have added. There is no flawless solution yet due to technical difficulties, so use the solution you feel best suits your needs or use separate software for your presentation needs.

The font size is too small
--------------------------

The font size is automatically calculated based on how much text there is per section, so these may help:

* Try to split the text into more sections by adding a blank line
* Set a [maximum amount of verses per slide for a Bible passage](/Bible_tab#Layout_of_Bible_passages "wikilink")
* Change the [maximum font size](/General_tab#Maximum_font_size "wikilink") to a higher value
* Lower the [maximum amount of characters per line](/General_tab#Maximum_characters_per_line "wikilink")
* Uncheck the [uniform font size](/General_tab#Use_uniform_font_size "wikilink")

VLC is not found even though it is installed
--------------------------------------------

It is probably because your VLC version is incompatible with Quelea. You cannot use a 64-bit version of VLC with Quelea if you use the 32-bit installer of Quelea and vice versa. To check if this is the case for Windows users, an easy way is to look in your `Program Files` (usually `C:\Program Files`) folder. If this is the issue you will most likely also find a folder called `Program Files (x86)` that contains your 32-bit installations. 

If Quelea is in one folder (for example `C:\Program Files`) and VLC is in the other (for example `C:\Program Files (x86`) you will need to download and install the corresponding versions of the software.

I cannot select Output 2 although the projector is connected
------------------------------------------------------------

First of all, check that you see anything from the computer on the projector. With Quelea you have to use what usually is called _Extended Desktop_, which means that the desktop becomes wider, stretching from your computer and onto your projector, allowing you to drag a window past the edge of one screen an onto the next. If you see the same things on both screens, the screen is _cloned_ and not extended. In that case, that is probably the problem and you need to change the graphics settings of your computer for that (often there is a keyboard shortcut for this, accessible with help of the _fn_ button, or _windows key + p_). If you do not see anything on your projector, it is probably that the computer is set to only use the local screen and you change that setting the same way as above. 

I cannot play YouTube videos
----------------------------

Due to video encryption that seems to be added to more and more YouTube videos today, YouTube support has been removed by default in Quelea 2017.0. A possible work-around would be to use one of the many services that offers you to download YouTube videos and then add it to the schedule as a regular video. If you really need this feature, contact the developers in the discussion forum on how to re-enable it.
