## User Options

### Interface language

Allows you to select the interface language of Quelea. At this moment,
Quelea is available in fourteen languages: English, German, Czech,
Swedish, Hungarian, Norwegian, Dutch, Lithuanian, Portuguese, Slovenian,
Spanish, Swahili, Bulgarian and French. More translations are greatly
appreciated, so if you know another language that you would like to
translate to, read more here [FAQ (Frequently Asked
Questions)](FAQ_\(Frequently_Asked_Questions\) "FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)")

### Check for update on startup

Does what it says: checks if there is any later release of Quelea if you
are connected to the Internet. However, this does not apply to so called
nightly builds (see question in [FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)](FAQ_\(Frequently_Asked_Questions\) "FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)")).

### Warn if only one monitor is connected

Gives you a warning each time you start Quelea without a second screen
for output. If you only mean to use Quelea to set up a schedule or only
will use the Mobile Lyrics you might want to deactivate this, otherwise
this is a good feature that will let you know if your projector has been
unplugged or has a glitch.

### Only preview one line per song section

With long Bible passages or songs with many verses, you might want to
prefer to only preview the first line of each slide to easier see all
the remaining slides.

### Autoplay videos in live panel

Will automatically play the video when you click “Go live”.

### Advance schedule on live display

Will make Quelea preview the next item in the schedule automatically
when you click “Go live”.

### Overflow current song into next song

Use Page Down key to continue to the next item at the end of the current
item.

### Preview item on image change

If an image is dragged and dropped on an item in the schedule that isn’t
already previewed, this will make Quelea automatically preview the
changed item. (This does not apply when individual themes are edited any
other way.)

### Show Video Library Tab (requires restart)

The Video Library Tab will appear next to the tabs for songs, bibles,
images and timers. You can then add videos to your schedule the same way
you [add an
image](Adding_items_to_Order_of_Service#adding-an-image "Adding items to Order of Service").
This option is known to make the start-up time longer on some system.

### Attempt to auto-translate songs

If you are connected to the Internet, this will attempt to automatically
translate a song to the [language you
enter](Translations#add-a-translation "Translations"). Remember that an
automatic translation seldom is perfect, and this is suggested to be
used only as a way to get the basic understanding of the song if you
have parts of the congregation that do not understand the language of
the song. Of course, if someone that understands both languages could
translate instead, that is always preferable.

### Copy song to schedule by default

Some users prefer to keep an original version of a song in the database
and then edit a copy of that song for each use. This option means that
all song that are added to the schedule are temporary copies that will
not be stored back to the database. It means that any edits you make to
a song in the schedule when this option is activated only will be stored
in that schedule, whereas any edits you make to a song in the database
also will stored in the database.

### Clear item from live view on removal from schedule

This deletes an item that is currently live if it is removed from
schedule. If not checked, the song will remain live until it is replaced
with another item.

### Embed media in schedule file

Makes the media available even if the schedule is sent to another
computer or the original file is deleted. This option is good if you
want to make sure everything is available the next time the schedule is
opened, but in case you have large files in your schedule this can make
it hard (or even impossible) to email it to another user.

### Show small song information

Displays the name of the song in the lower/upper right or left corner.
Change the percentage of the screen that it can take up if you feel that
the text is too small.

### Show small bible passage information

Displays the book, chapter and verse(s) of the passage in the
lower/upper right or left corner. Change the percentage of the screen
that it can take up if you feel that the text is too small.

### Thumbnail size

If you feel that the thumbnail size of the preview slides for
presentations, PDF files or images is too small, you can change it here.

## Text Options

### Capitalise on each line

Depending on grammatical rules or aesthetic preference you might or
might not want to use this. The first letter of each new line will be
capitalised if checked, otherwise the capitalisations entered when
adding a song will be the only ones used.

### Use uniform font size

Quelea is built to wrap the lyrics of each slide to fit the screen as
best as possible. This option allows you to choose whether or not this
should be done per slide or per item. Per slide means that some slides
might use a larger font size than others within the same song, and per
item means that the font size of some slides will be smaller than they
could be but the font size will not differ from slide to slide.

### Maximum font size

Since Quelea automatically wraps the text to fit the screen it might
sometimes use a very large font size, especially if the lyrics are
short. With this option, you can set an upper limit for the font size.

### Additional line spacing

This allows you to set an additional distance between lines in the
lyrics.

### Maximum characters per line

Set the maximum number of characters per line. Smaller number equals a
slimmer line of lyrics, higher means wider line of lyrics (until entire
screen is filled). Depending on where the line breaks are made in the
lyrics, the proper number can change the lyrics to a smaller or bigger
font size.
