Quelea is a competent cross platform church software developed to bring
the best features from similar software, spiced with unique features, to
every church for free. The founders have developed this software
entirely on their spare time and the software is completely open source,
which means that anybody that knows how to program in Java could adjust
the software for themselves or help developing Quelea for everybody.

In the first chapter we will first get acquainted with the software and
then walk through the basic features. You will notice that Quelea is
very intuitive and that there are instructions embedded to the software
to make it easy for anyone to use it. If you have any questions, do not
hesitate to ask them in the official Quelea discussion forum:
