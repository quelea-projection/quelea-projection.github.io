# Layout

One might say Quelea is divided into three sections: [Schedule and Database](/#Schedule_and_Database "wikilink"), [Preview](/#Preview "wikilink") and [Live](/#Live "wikilink").

Schedule and Database
---------------------

Below you see the Order of Service and the Database, where all your songs will be stored and can be organised for different occasion. The first time you start Quelea you will need to [add songs](/Adding_items_to_Order_of_Service#Adding_a_song "wikilink") to the database. Once you have added songs to the database you can start [organizing them](/Adding_items_to_Order_of_Service#Organizing_a_schedule "wikilink") in the Order of Service, or a Schedule as it also is called.

Below is an example of songs in a database and an Order of Service (Schedule):

Preview
-------

The preview allows you to see what your items will look like before you show them live. You can preview different slides by clicking the different text sections or by using your keyboard’s up and down arrow keys. When you are ready to show the item live, just click the “Go live” button.

Live
----

In the live section you can switch between the slides by clicking the different text sections, by using your keyboard’s up and down arrow keys, the Page Up and the Page Down keys or by using section shortcuts (see [Shortcuts and other things that are good to know](/Shortcuts_and_other_things_that_are_good_to_know "wikilink")). If you are not ready to show the text live just yet, you have three options to hide the text: Logo button, Black Screen or Clear screen.

### Logo button

If you select the Logo button, the [logo you have pre-assigned](/Logo "wikilink") will appear and any changes of slide or item will not appear until you deselect the button.

If you select the Black Screen button, the projector output will be completely black, not displaying any changes of slide or item until you deselect the button.

### Clear screen

If you select the Clear Screen button, any text will disappear and the background image/video/colour you have pre-assigned will be the only thing visible on the output (see [Themes](/Themes "wikilink")). Any changes of slide or item will not appear until you deselect the button.
