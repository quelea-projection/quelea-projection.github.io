# Mobile applications privacy policy

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy defines how the mobile applications Quelea
Mobile Lyrics, Quelea Mobile Remote and Quelea Mobile Stage handle user
data.

## Permissions used

### Full network access

Only used to connect to the Quelea server locally. The application can
be used with no Internet connection as long as it has access to the same
network as the local server.

### Prevent phone from sleeping

Means that the screen is kept active as long as the application is
running. It is possible to manually turn the screen off at any time.

### View Wi-Fi connections

Used in the auto-connect feature to find the server IP.

### Take pictures and videos

Only used to open the camera when scanning a QR code.

## Personal data

We take user privacy seriously and do not collect any personal or
non-personal information about the user. Hence, data, personal or
non-personal, about or from the user is neither collected nor
transferred without user approval. All possible
interaction with the developer(s) are always optional in form of an
email where the user can decide for him-/herself how much information 
he/she wants to disclose.
The only time the camera is used (only applicable for
Quelea Mobile Lyrics and Quelea Stage Mode) is when the user chooses to
scan a QR code and it is used only for that purpose. No pictures or
videos are either taken, stored or shared in any way.

Since no data is collected about the user, no data will or can be shared with
or sold to any third party.

## Changes of the Privacy Policy

We reserve the right to change our Privacy Policy at any time without
notifying the users, though any changes are most likely to regard
grammatical mistakes, additional information about new permissions or
further clarification of what have been stated above. Feel free to take
a look at the [revision history of this page](https://github.com/quelea-projection/quelea-projection.github.io/commits/master/docs/Android_Applications_Privacy_Policy.md) 
to view any changes that have been made since this page was created.
