# Android applications privacy policy

Introduction
------------

This Privacy Policy defines how the Android mobile applications Quelea Mobile Lyrics, Quelea Mobile Remote and Quelea Mobile Stage handle user data.

Permissions used
----------------

### Full network access

Only used to connect to the Quelea server locally. The application can be used with no Internet connection as long as it has access to the same network as the local server.

### Prevent phone from sleeping

Means that the screen is kept active as long as the application is running. It is possible to manually turn the screen off at any time.

### View Wi-Fi connections

Used in the auto-connect feature to find the server IP.

### Take pictures and videos

Only used to open the camera when scanning a QR code.

Personal data
-------------

We take user privacy seriously and do not collect any personal or non-personal information about the user. Hence, data, personal or non-personal, about or from the user is neither collected nor transferred without user approval. Crash logs and other possible interaction with the developer(s) are always optional in form of an email, using the device's default email client, where the user can decide for him-/herself how much information he/she wants to disclose. The only data transferred online is through the translation feature (only applicable for Quelea Mobile Lyrics) and nothing else but the current lyrics is sent. The lyrics is translated through Bing Translate and we therefore ask you to review their privacy policy in terms of how that data is used. The only time the camera is used (only applicable for Quelea Mobile Lyrics and Quelea Stage Mode) is when the user chooses to scan a QR code and it is used only for that purpose. No pictures or videos are either taken, stored or shared in any way.

Since no data is recollected about the user, no data will be shared with or sold to any third party.

Changes to the Privacy Policy
-----------------------------

We reserve the right to change our Privacy Policy at any time without notifying the users, though any changes are most likely to regard grammatical mistakes, additional information about new permissions or further clarification of what have been stated above. Feel free to take a look at the revision history of this page to view any changes that have been made since this page was created.
