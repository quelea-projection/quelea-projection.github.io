# Saving and sharing schedules

Quelea can save a schedule for later use or help you print one. To save a schedule that you have
[created](Adding_items_to_Order_of_Service "Adding items to Order of Service"), 
click “File” and
“Save Schedule” or “Save Schedule as...” If you have opened an existing
file, choosing "Save Schedule as..." will always let you save changes to a new schedule
whereas "Save" will overwrite the file you have open. The first time you click either of them however, they will both
let you create a file that contains your schedule. Quelea saves all
information to the file, so even if your database is deleted or
you send it to another user, everything will still be accessible.
If you do not want to embed media resources (to reduce the file size),
disable [embedding media resources](General_tab#embed-media-in-schedule-file "General tab").

Printing a schedule allows you to print the order of service, not the
lyrics of a song or the text of a Bible passage. The same goes for
exporting a schedule to a PDF.

If you would like to export all songs (with lyrics) to PDF files, you
click “Schedule” and “Export songs to PDF”. The songs will then be
exported as a compressed Zip file that you first will have to decompress (unzip)
if you want to view the PDF files.
